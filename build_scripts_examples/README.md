# üöÄ Liquibase in Automation
This repository provides examples of running Liquibase Secure (formerly Liquibase Pro) within different automation platforms. [Get Liquibase.](https://www.liquibase.com/download-secure)

# üîß Included Examples
* [Ansible Tower](Ansible_Tower/liquibase_playbook.yml)  
* [AWS CodeBuild](AWS_CodeBuild/buildspec.yml)  
* [Azure DevOps](Azure_DevOps/azure_pipelines_docker.yml)  
* [Bitbucket](Bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines.yml)  
* [CircleCI](CircleCI/config.yml)  
* [GitHub Actions](GitHub_Actions/liquibase_workflow.yml)  
* [GitLab](GitLab/gitlab-ci.yml)  
* [Jenkins](Jenkins/Jenkinsfile) 

# üìã Methodology
Each pipeline follows these steps:
1. Check out the repository
1. Run the Liquibase flow using Docker
1. Commit and push updates to the repository

**Notes:**
* Some pipelines use a personal access token (e.g., GitHub Actions) to enable read/write access. Update the repository configuration and credentials to match your environment.
* Reports and logs can be delivered to a shared network location, email distribution list, or S3 bucket using our [Secure extension](https://docs.liquibase.com/secure/integration-guide-5-0/how-to-connect-liquibase-to-amazon-s3).

# üí° Assumptions
* Pipelines are reviewed and updated before execution
* Only Liquibase Secure features are used
* [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/liquibase/liquibase-secure) container utilized
* Source control is git based
* Local agents/runners are used where specified
* All required environment variables are defined in the pipeline or configuration file
* Credentials are retrieved from a secure location

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Environment Variables
These environment variables must be set before running Liquibase.  
When using the Liquibase Docker container, pass them in at runtime.  
When running locally, set them in your shell or environment before invocation.
